# ITS1AnalysisQIIME2
qiime2 bioinformatics pipeline for ITS1 region analysis

We seek to detect plant pathogens by the means of amplicon sequencing and metagenomics.
We used the Thermo Fisher Fusion Method to do library prep. For sequencing, we used the Ion Torrent platform. 
The ITS1 region was sequenced two times unidirectionally using primers ITS1F and ITS2R.

Ths script here will take you from a raw sequences to an ASV table with taxonomy lables.
